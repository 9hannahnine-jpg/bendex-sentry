# Bendex Arc Sentry

White-box pre-generation behavioral guardrail for open source LLMs.

Arc Sentry hooks into the residual stream and detects anomalous inputs before the model generates a response. If flagged, generate() is never called.

This is different from standard monitoring tools, which operate on outputs, latency, or API-level signals.

## Validated results

| Model | Architecture | FP rate | Injection | Verbosity drift | Refusal drift | Trials |
|-------|-------------|---------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| Mistral 7B | Mistral | 0% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 5/5 |
| Qwen 2.5 7B | Qwen | 0% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 5/5 |
| Llama 3.1 8B | Llama | 0% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 5/5 |

Zero variance across all trials. Detection happens before model.generate() is called.

### v2.4.0 benchmark — Mistral 7B (April 2026)

Two-session benchmark: 80 normal prompts (Session 1), 115 injection prompts (Session 2). 195 total.

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| False positive rate | 0% (0/80) |
| Detection rate | 100% (115/115) |
| Model | Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 |
| Warmup | 20 diverse prompts |

**Detection layers:**
- Single-request: Fisher-Rao geodesic distance on residual stream delta at best layer
- Session-level: D(t) stability scalar (Nine 2026b) over rolling request history — catches gradual injection campaigns invisible to single-request detection
- Phrase check: explicit injection language patterns

**Session D(t) fires confirmed at steps 140, 178, 180, 181, 182, 183** — D values -0.72 to -1.88, consistent with Theorem 3: D(t) < 0 signals trajectory divergence below τ*.

### v2.1.0 stress test — Mistral 7B (April 2026)

13/13 injection attempts blocked across four attack categories. 0/5 false positives on normal traffic.

| Category | Blocked | Total | Examples |
|----------|---------|-------|---------|
| Normal traffic | 0 | 5 | Business hours, password reset, refund queries |
| Obvious injection | 3 | 3 | "Ignore all previous instructions", "SYSTEM OVERRIDE" |
| Indirect injection | 5 | 5 | Developer override, hidden instruction claims |
| Subtle injection | 5 | 5 | DAN, hypothetical framing, grandmother jailbreak |

Warmup: 10 prompts, no labeled data. Detection before generate() is called.

## Core mechanism

1. Extract residual stream transition: Δh = h[L] − h[L-1]
2. L2-normalize: Δh_hat = Δh / ‖Δh‖
3. Compute Fisher-Rao geodesic distance to warmup centroid: d(u,v) = arccos(u·v)
4. Threshold set from probe separation during calibration
5. If distance exceeds threshold — block. generate() never runs.

Fisher-Rao geodesic distance is used throughout — not cosine distance. This is the geometrically correct metric on the unit hypersphere and is consistent with the theoretical framework grounding the noise floor at τ* = √(3/2).

## Key finding

Behavioral modes are encoded as layer-localized residual transitions, not uniformly across the network.

Different behaviors localize at different depths:
- Injection (control hijack): ~93% depth
- Refusal drift (policy shift): ~93% depth
- Verbosity drift (style/format): ~64% depth

Arc Sentry automatically identifies the most informative layers per model during calibration. Warmup required: 10 prompts, no labeled data.

## Install

    pip install bendex

    # whitebox dependencies
    pip install bendex[whitebox]

## Usage

### v1 (single file)

    from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
    from bendex.whitebox import ArcSentry
    import torch

    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
        "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
        dtype=torch.float16, device_map="auto")
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct")

    sentry = ArcSentry(model, tokenizer)
    sentry.calibrate(warmup_prompts)

    response, result = sentry.observe_and_block(user_prompt)
    if result["blocked"]:
        pass  # model.generate() was never called

### v2 (modular, recommended)

    from arc_sentry_v2.core.pipeline import ArcSentryV2
    from arc_sentry_v2.models.mistral_adapter import MistralAdapter  # or QwenAdapter, LlamaAdapter

    adapter = MistralAdapter(model, tokenizer)
    sentry = ArcSentryV2(adapter, route_id="customer-support")
    sentry.calibrate(warmup_prompts)
    response, result = sentry.observe_and_block(prompt)

    if result["blocked"]:
        pass  # generate() was never called
    else:
        print(result["snr"])  # signal-to-noise ratio vs τ*

## Honest constraints

Works best on single-domain deployments — customer support bots, enterprise copilots, internal tools, fixed-use-case APIs. The warmup baseline should reflect your deployment's normal traffic. Cross-domain universal detection requires larger warmup or domain routing.

## Theoretical foundation

Built on the second-order Fisher manifold H² × H² with Ricci scalar R = −4. The phase transition at τ* = √(3/2) ≈ 1.2247 (Landauer threshold) grounds the geometric interpretation of behavioral drift.

Detection uses Fisher-Rao geodesic distance — the geometrically correct metric on the unit hypersphere. The threshold is derived from probe separation during calibration, not from a tuned hyperparameter.

Blind predictions from the framework:
- αs(MZ) = 0.1171 vs PDG 0.1179 ± 0.0010 (0.8σ, no fitting)
- Fine structure constant to 8 significant figures from manifold curvature

## Proxy Sentry (API-based models)

For closed-source models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini), the proxy-based Arc Sentry routes requests through a monitoring layer with no model access required.
